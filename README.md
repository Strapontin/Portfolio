# About Strapontin

I am an independant Security Researcher in Solidity. While I entered in the field as an SR, I am also really interested in the Smart Contract Developer side of things, and have a few plans of projects to build. I am always looking for new opportunities, may it be a job opening, private security audit...

| [Sablier Flow](https://codehawks.cyfrin.io/c/2024-10-sablier/s/295)                         | The protocol is rounding down fees, limiting income for low decimals tokens                                                           | This finding allowed me to reach my first top 5. There was only 4 findings in this contest (all lows), and this was the 2nd less found                                                                                          |
| [Plaza Finance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-plaza-finance-judging/issues/891) | The finding describes two attack paths where the protocol's fees can be drastically reduced, or a functionnality failure would happen | This finding was my first selected submission for the final report in a competitive contest. The clear writing I'm used to make combined with 2 attack paths I found for the vulnerability allowed me to achieve this milestone |
